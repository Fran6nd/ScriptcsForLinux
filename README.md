# ScriptcsForLinux

The purpose of this project is having a small utility to use instead of [scriptcs](http://scriptcs.net/) which was painful for me to use on my linux.<br>
This project uses [Mono](https://www.monodevelop.com/download/) to build and run the program but you can use microsoft's csc command as well.
